Maria was very responsive and helpful when we communicated with her. She has a lovely home and wonderful garden with lots of fruits and vegetables! <br/>The only improvement I would make is on the pool temp. The pool and jacuzzi could have been a bit warmer. They are heated by solar panels so there’s no way to turn up the heat.",

      "response": "Thank you, Kelly, for your sweet words! I wanted to clarify that the spa is being heated by electrical power, up to 107 degrees if needed. <br/>Kelly is a new mother that brought her baby and elderly frail parents with her for this brief two night stay. Unfortunately, her exhaustion and anxiety got the best of her. She failed to read the listing description, check in instructions and the House Manual that is prominently displayed in the kitchen area. By answering her numerous unnecessary questions at all hours of day and night (both nights), I believe I showed her human understanding and compassion that will lead her to become a better short term rental guest in the future😊.",

We loved how easy it was to meet the checkout list - simple and nothing too onerous. Supplies were well stocked and better than most other airbnb's we've stayed at (e.g., kitchenware, kitchen supplies, extra bathroom supplies, lots of towels, etc). Five stars for both Maria and this home.",

They had everything and more that you might need for your stay!  We traveled with kiddos and the house with the corn hole and horse shoes plus pool and hot tub was wonderful and keep our boys busy the entire time!  There’s an amazing kids room with toys and books that became our little guys favorite place to be!  More than enough space inside the home and the outdoor seating areas with the fireplace and the outdoor kitchen was just perfect to sit and enjoy and cook while we watch the kids play!  Their garden is spectacular and a beautiful place to look at as well - respectfully admiring the hard work that had to go into creating that beautiful space!  From beginning to end this was our best and favorite Airbnb experience. Maria was fantastic!  We booked pretty last minute and she was responsive and answered all the questions we had. We explained our trip with added dinner party guests and Maria was fantastic and supportive and helped us get that situated as well!  She was also thoughtful on setting up the pool safety gate knowing that we had some younger kids running around as well!  Working with Maria made this experience easy and took away a lot of the stress and worry so that we could just enjoy our trip!  No question we will absolutely stay here again and not only this property but the others they own as well!  Highly recommend this home and Maria for all your stays in Roseville and the Sacramento area!!  Can’t say enough about how truly fantastic this experience was!  Thank you Maria for everything!!",

The home is beautifully laid out (we were a group of 5 adults and a dog), so everyone had their own bathroom and their own space.  The common spaces were spacious and yet still cozy-feeling, and sitting outside (which is where we spent about 95% of the time, outside of sleeping) was so incredibly relaxing and fun!  It was a fantastic place to reconnect with family I hadn’t seen in over two decades!  <br/>The pool is refreshing, and the sound of the waterfall so soothing.  Everyone enjoyed the spa, and playing corn hole, and eating around the huge outdoor dining table.  The dog loved the grounds and was happily exhausted each night from all the running around.  <br/>Anastasiya and her husband are so kind and friendly!  This is the first time I’ve ever messaged the host just to say how incredibly great the stay was while we were still there!  It’s THAT GOOD. We’ll be back!!",

      "comments": "Our family had a wonderful experience staying at this home. It was everything as advertised.  The backyard was truly an oasis and there was plenty of room (inside and out) for our family of seven to spread out and relax. We spent time every day in the pool and spa.  Also spent time every day in the amazing California (outdoor) living room.  The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful.  The beautiful palm and oak trees added to the oasis feel. The inside of the house was just as spacious and comfortable.  The beds were also very comfortable. The kitchen area was huge and there was plenty of room for everyone to prepare their favorite meals together. The dishwasher was the quietest we have ever heard (or rather not heard). The washer and dryer were a great help to keep up with beach towels and bathing suits. The location was within 15-20 minutes from most of the activities we were interested in.  Shopping and restaurants also within 10-20 minutes.  Wish we could be there every day!",

There was lots of space in the living/dining/kitchen areas, so we never felt like we were on top of each other. The primary suite was large and well-appointed. The other two bedrooms worked out great for our adult children. The fenced backyard and covered patio was nice; it was a great space to sit and watch our dogs run around.<br/>Location of the house was close to shopping, restaurants, parks, and freeways; and it was centrally located, so it was convenient for getting to our family events in the Sacramento delta, Natomas, and Placer County.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay, and felt at home. Venci was a great host; and was quite responsive when I had questions.",

Garage access made it easy to get myself & my 2 small dogs unloaded late at night. <br/>Venci was quick to respond, great instructions & the home was beautiful!<br/>As a heads up only if you do have dogs, the neighbors behind & on the side of the home have dogs. They were very loud, barking & chasing the fences when I would try to let my dogs. My dogs are small so the outside was a little uncomfortable since one of the neighbors just continued to let their dog jump against the fence & shake it. As a guest in the neighborhood I didn’t want to do anything that would have them to continue to bark by having my dogs outside so unfortunately we stayed inside expect for potty breaks & did not really use the patio.",

Our family of six came to my hometown of Sacramento for a special family event and this accommodation allowed us to spend quality time together relaxing in the pool, sitting in the beautiful backyard and taking walks in nature in nearby  Ancil Hoffman park. The house is fantastic with modern yet comfortable furnishings. If we need to return to Sacramento again I would love to stay here again. Stu was a great host, checking in to make sure all was well. We would give this stay more than 5 stars if we could!",

      "comments": "We've had a wonderful time staying at Stuart's house! There's plenty of space for a family to get together, as well as have their privacy, and everything is just so smartly designed and optimized for fun and relaxation. With a pool deep enough to have a diving board, located next to a small putting green and boards for bean bag toss, your cranky teen may just feel like a small kid again, while the grandpa can relax in the plentiful shade of the covered patio, several umbrellas, and the trees around the backyard. Pool chairs, towels, sunscreen - everything is within reach. The kitchen is stocked with any and all utensils you may possibly need, and even fresh coffee beans in the grinder. There's plenty of options for family entertainment, from children’s books to board games and home theater projector, as well as fast internet connection. What stood out for us was how Stuart's house combines all the smart tech with the warm atmosphere, which made our stay so pleasant and memorable.",

Fully stocked with all the things you could ever need, immaculately cleaned, comfy beds, and what….am I burying the lead?  THE POOL!!!  Perfect temp to cool off on warm sacramento days!  The host was prompt with follow up upon check in and as all perfect stays go, we didn’t need much during our time there.  Close to yummy food (eat at the close by Vietnamese restaurant, you won’t regret it), grocery stores,  Effie Yaw Nature center and anything else you could desire.  We took a walk over to the nature center and saw a family of deer taking a nap under the shade trees.  What a highlight for my kids!  Thank you to this wonderful home for allowing our family to come together and make memories.  We will not ever forget it!",

We travel regularly, so AirBnB has been a wonderful experience. We did AirBnB with another apartment in San Francisco and have always loved hosting.",

      "comments": "Laryssa's place was the cleanest airbnb Ive been in. There were bottled waters in the fridge and that was a nice touch because normally we have to pass by store to get some before checking in. As soon as we walked in the door, besides the nice decor, there was a beautiful Christmas tree. I loved the minimalist touch, it felt great to not have clutter. We slepted great. Laryssa also reached out letting me know condiments were now provided in individual packets but if I needed anything else, she was in the area and to let her know. I would definitely consider her place when Im in the area again!",

The house is fulled stocked so don't worry if you forget to pack your toothpaste, qtips or teabags.  Having access to a washer/dryer (with detergent provided) was handy, my kids loved the rope swing and the beautiful Christmas decorations.  My whole family felt extremely comfortable in the house and we hope it's available when we're in the area next time.  Thank you for sharing your cozy home with us, Laryssa!",

Jennifer is so sweet, kind and attentive. Shes very responsive and checks in on me. I honestly wish all airbnb's were owned by her that way i could always book with her. Shes very special and one of a kind! Thank you for such an amazing stay! 👏 ❤️🙏",

Jennifer was also very easy to communicate with. Thank you for the lovely stay.",

The property and neighborhood are very old and the home and decor are somewhat quirky, but the home was clean and met our needs and we enjoyed our stay. I recommend guests pay close attention to Jennifer’s detailed instructions regarding the heating/AC and swamp cooler as it is a much different set up than most places and you will want to be sure you adjust it correctly to meet your needs. The price is right for guests on a budget who are not expecting luxury. I am grateful to have found this economical home large enough to accommodate our family when we needed to travel to Roseville.",

This is a family-friendly home with thoughtful touches to make things easier for parents and kids (kids cups, games, toys, Pac Man machine, first aid, etc.). The open kitchen/living space and cute patio are great for gathering, but the separated bedrooms offer privacy, too. Roseville isn’t very big, so it’s easy to get around, and my husband even jogged/walked to a local donut shop and grocery store one morning. Thank you for being a great host, Jennifer!",

The showers are clean and has shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The kitchen is homie with everything we need to cook a meal for our group. I lover her patio with all the furniture, bbq grill, and an outdoor fireplace. We had so much fun at Jennifer’s place and would book it again for our tournament next year! Thanks Jennifer!",

    "houseRules": "There is a maximum of 6 guests staying overnight. If you plan on having visitors, please ask for permission. This is a no party, no event house!\n\nUp to 3 small pets are allowed with permission for an additional fee of $30 per trip. If the trip is more than 3 nights, there will be a separate charge of $10 per pet, per night. Please write to me and ask for permission before bringing a pet. I will have to send a separate payment request for additional pets after 3 nights. PLEASE CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR PET.  PICKING UP  POOP IS NOT PART OF THE CLEANING COST. THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE IF THERE IS POOP LEFT IN THE YARD.  If a pet is in the house without permission you will pay the $10 per pet, per night plus an additional $50\n\nNO SMOKING. NO PARTIES. No recreational drugs. No open flames. No excess noise after 10:00 pm. Avoid disturbing neighbors. A $200 cleaning fee will be deducted from your deposit if smoking occurs in the unit. Smoking is allowed outside but please dispose of the cigarette or cigar outside in the ashtray. There is a ring doorbell  camera outside the front of the house pointing to the driveway and street, so we can see how many enter the house.  \n\nThis is a NO PARTY house. Parties, loud get-togethers, or gatherings are not allowed because of neighbor issues, and possible damage to property. If a party, loud gathering, or loud disturbance does occur, or if neighbors or other guests call for a loud disturbance, you will forfeit your security deposit and will be evicted immediately without refund.\n\nA limited supply of shampoo, toilet paper, paper towels and cleaning supplies are available at the house. Raleys is 5 minutes away if you need additional supplies for your stay.\n\nWe have 3 propane tanks for the BBQ and fire pit. We will do our best to keep them filled, but this is a perk not a requirement. If a tank is empty, feel free to replace it with the extra one on the patio.  Please leave empty one by the back door so that we know to refill it.  Please clean the barbeque with wire brush provided after use.\n\nWe ask that you leave the house tidy and in good order. Upon check-out, make sure the kitchen is clean (dishes rinsed off and put in the dishwasher) and all furniture are put back to its original locations. Strip bedding from beds that were used and leave on the floor as well as any towels that have been used.\nAdditional cleaning fee may apply if deep cleaning is required. Owner is not responsible for injuries to any person or animal on the property.",

This is a no party, no event house!\n\nUp to 3 small pets are allowed with permission for an additional fee of $30 per trip. If the trip is more than 3 nights, there will be a separate charge of $10 per pet, per night. Please write to me and ask for permission before bringing a pet. I will have to send a separate payment request for additional pets after 3 nights. PLEASE CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR PET.  PICKING UP  POOP IS NOT PART OF THE CLEANING COST. THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE IF THERE IS POOP LEFT IN THE YARD.  If a pet is in the house without permission you will pay the $10 per pet, per night plus an additional $50\n\nNO SMOKING. NO PARTIES. No recreational drugs. No open flames. No excess noise after 10:00 pm. Avoid disturbing neighbors. A $200 cleaning fee will be deducted from your deposit if smoking occurs in the unit. Smoking is allowed outside but please dispose of the cigarette or cigar outside in the ashtray. There is a ring doorbell  camera outside the front of the house pointing to the driveway and street, so we can see how many enter the house.  \n\nThis is a NO PARTY house. Parties, loud get-togethers, or gatherings are not allowed because of neighbor issues, and possible damage to property. If a party, loud gathering, or loud disturbance does occur, or if neighbors or other guests call for a loud disturbance, you will forfeit your security deposit and will be evicted immediately without refund.\n\nA limited supply of shampoo, toilet paper, paper towels and cleaning supplies are available at the house. Raleys is 5 minutes away if you need additional supplies for your stay.\n\nWe have 3 propane tanks for the BBQ and fire pit. We will do our best to keep them filled, but this is a perk not a requirement. If a tank is empty, feel free to replace it with the extra one on the patio.  Please leave empty one by the back door so that we know to refill it.  Please clean the barbeque with wire brush provided after use.\n\nWe ask that you leave the house tidy and in good order. Upon check-out, make sure the kitchen is clean (dishes rinsed off and put in the dishwasher) and all furniture are put back to its original locations. Strip bedding from beds that were used and leave on the floor as well as any towels that have been used.\nAdditional cleaning fee may apply if deep cleaning is required. Owner is not responsible for injuries to any person or animal on the property.\n",

For those looking to work remotely, the wifi is fast, and there are two desks provided. My only note is that the carpet could be better cleaned. Overall, great stay.",
